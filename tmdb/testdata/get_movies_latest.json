  "overview": "It tackles the hot button issue of sexist Middle Eastern inheritance rules dictated by Islamic Sharia law, under which a man has a right to take double the share of a woman. The drama turns on two perennially bickering sisters, named Mariam and Noura, whose father dies and unexpectedly leaves a large sum of money in the bank. According to Sharia law, their brother can claim half of the inheritance because he’s the male sibling. Enraged by this injustice, the sisters put their differences aside and join forces in concocting a scheme to get their hands on the cash before their brother finds out about their father’s death.",
